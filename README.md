# üè• Identifying Age-Related Health Conditions: Data Challenge

![Project Cover](https://github.com/AniMilina/ICR---Identifying-Age-Related-Conditions/raw/main/cover_1.jpg)

Welcome to the **ICR - Identifying Age-Related Conditions**, hosted by InVitro Cell Research, LLC (ICR)! üåü

Join us in tackling a crucial healthcare challenge. Can you predict if an individual has any of three specific medical conditions? Your mission: develop a model using health characteristic data to make accurate predictions. By harnessing the power of predictive models, we're aiming to streamline diagnosis processes and ensure patient privacy while uncovering connections between health traits and conditions.

##  Competition Goal:
Predict whether an individual has one or more age-related conditions (Class 1) or none (Class 0), based on their health characteristics.

##  Why It Matters:
Aging brings a range of health concerns, and this competition aims to improve predictive accuracy for age-related conditions. Current models like XGBoost and random forest fall short. Your contribution could shape the future of healthcare!

## Tasks:
1. **Explore Data:** Dive into health characteristics and target distribution.
2. **Data Prep:** Handle outliers, fill in missing values, and engineer features.
3. **Feature Craft:** Extract, encode, and generate insightful features.
4. **Model Magic:** Choose and fine-tune ML algorithms for classification.
5. **Evaluate Models:** Measure performance, training times, and more.
6. **Champion Model:** Compare, select, and identify the best model.
7. **Dig Deeper:** Conduct a detailed analysis of characteristic-condition relationships.
